# Pollen-Grain-Classification

Pollen grains play an important role in classification system of plants. 
Pollen morphological characters are very useful in plant classification and identification of plants. Pollen studies are widely used in allergy and epidemiology research, fossil fuel exploration, forensic science, food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industry, biotechnology, and so many other fields. Hence classification of pollen grains is a challenge that can be effectively done by computational intelligence approach. The traditional method of pollen classification analyses the pollen morphological characters using microscopy.

This procedure is tedious and requires experts from the field of palynology
